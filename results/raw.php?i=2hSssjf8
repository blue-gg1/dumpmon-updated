--[[This simple program allows you to edit a ComputerCraft 
program at pastebin.com and it will always update it before 
running it. Very useful if you have many computers that need 
to run the same code, for instance Direwolf20's Season 5frame 
quarry with the 16 turtles. Each has to run the same code, but 
editing then reloading that code into each turtle is tedious. 
If you use "pastebin get M9a2L0Yw startup", this will 
automatically get and run the program on startup or reboot.]]
